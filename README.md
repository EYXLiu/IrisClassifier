# IrisClassifier
SVM, Multiclass Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree Custom Python implementations + Scikit-Learn training using Iris Flower Classification Dataset

# Class implementations
Implemented classes for Multi Class Support Vector Machines, Multi Class Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees. 
SVM: 
* Creates decision boundaries in higher-dimensional space to seperate the different classes
MCLogisticRegression:
* Uses one-vs-rest approach for multi-class classification, finds percent that it's each class and returns whichever has the highest probability
Decision Trees
* Splits Dataset into feature thresholds, can be extended for form Random Forest Models when the dataset is sufficiently large


# Scikit-learn
Uses scikit-learn models compare predictions, most predictions being the exact same accuracy that Scikit-learn's models have
